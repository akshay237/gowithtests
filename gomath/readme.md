### Acceptance Test
*  Sometimes it's nice - actually, almost all of the time it's nice - to write a test that tells you when you've finished writing the whole usable feature. 
*  Not just a test that tells you that a particular function is working in the way you expect, but a test that tells you that the whole thing you're trying to achieve - the 'feature' - is complete.
